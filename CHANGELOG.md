- [#10] fix(modrinth): assume mods need to be loaded on both sides (see comments in code for reasoning)
- [#12] fix(installer): removing a file from the pack now correctly removes it when updating with `sculk install` (files not managed by Sculk will not be touched).
- [#11] fix(refresh): add `--watch` argument to watch the file system for changes and refresh when they are detected.
